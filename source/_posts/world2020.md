**Volcano Taal in the Philippines, bird flu in Saudi Arabia, unknown disease in Nigeria, mysterious virus found in Brazil, etc**. All this makes people think of the line strayed from the earth: "In the  beginning, no one cared about this disaster. It was just a mountain fire, a drought, the extinction of a species, the disappearance of a city. Until this disaster It's about everyone.

The alarm bell of nature has sounded! Man and nature are originally a community of destiny. If humans do not respect the laws of nature, the bitter fruits of environmental degradation will  eventually be swallowed by humans themselves.German philosopher Hegel once said: "The only lesson that human beings can learn from history is that human beings have never learned from history." Human beings have never been able to control nature, and human beings have never conquered the earth. Humans cannot conquer the earth, and the only thing we can do is take care of her. It's time to learn to care for animals and live in peace with wildlife. It's time to learn to respect nature and protect the environment.
