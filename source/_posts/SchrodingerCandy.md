The ugly duckling turned into a white swan, is it the result of enduring ridicule and low looking, and trying to transform; or is it born as a white swan, this is just a destiny.
Which do you believe?
Fairy tale: a "Schrodinger's candy"
Literally speaking, fairy tales tell stories for children.

<!--more-->

Our earliest encounters with fairy tales are bedtime stories when we were young, colorful illustrations in books, and bizarre and magical plots in animation works; it has rich imagination, a lot of exaggeration and anthropomorphism, and is popular and vivid.
Today's fairy tales are defined as children's "exclusive products" and are representative of warmth. But in the early days, fairy tales were not so full of innocence.
In addition to taking place in the field of literature, the study of fairy tales is also an important part of the exploration of folklore. The Finnish school is one of them. They are devoted to making detailed analysis of folklore stories and tracing their roots from the evolution of stories, in order to mine the prototype of folklore stories.
In fact, all prototypes of the human story can correspond to the human society itself-whether it is the society at the time of the story or the current society where the story is passed, the boring academic research is nothing more than reappearing history. However, these studies confirm that many fairy tales themselves are the cutbacks and adaptations of folklore stories in various places. It is rare to see children in folklore narrators. They are adults of a certain period, come from different countries, nations, and classes, and have different beliefs. Therefore, the story has adult colors of one kind or another.

The book "The Grimm's Fairy Tales" is a classic representative of the consistency and conflict between the current fairy tales and the original folk tales. On the one hand, this book published in 1812, from its original name "Child and Family Story Collection", it can be seen that it has the intention to tell the story to children; on the other hand, this book has undergone several revisions before it came out, After it was actually released, it was criticized, and it was regarded as a failed work that wanted to please both scholars and children.
At that time, folk stories had just changed from the background of children to their own independent space in the family and other factors, combined with industrial development, urbanization and other factors, from word of mouth stories to bedtime reading. The Brothers Grimm's collection of stories is actually the completion of writing to restore the public discourse.
The composition of these popular discourses is too complicated. Some of them are the language of farmers, and some come from the middle class; some of them are the product of religious education, and some are short "fence words" among parents.

For example, the story "Sleeping Beauty" is believed to be adapted from the 17th-century Italian folk tale "Sun, Moon, and Talia". In the original story, the plot we are familiar with is just an opening, and the latter is too bloody dissolute. This is actually the social map of Italy in the late Middle Ages-on the one hand is the call of the Renaissance humanism, on the one hand is the court church's obsession with baroque style, which is extremely popular.
This is only a retelling and adaptation of the original story, not the original author. Compared with the former, the latter has one more possibility of completely serving children's enlightenment, but many works have their own literary value and ideological connotation that are far higher than what we think of as fairy tales. If we do not dialectically view Schopenhauer's sentence "The essence of life is suffering," these works are hard to escape from this law. For example, Wilde's "Happy Prince" has a central tone far from the word happy, except for the story's BAD ENDING, which describes the difficult life of the bottom people and the rich man's construction of a gold-encrusted sculpture with a lead heart. There is a strong contrast.

These fairy tales, when they first met, seemed to be a pumpkin carriage, candy from beautiful sugar paper, and unrealistic characters and situations. But as time goes by, the more it feels heavier and heavier.
Although it has colorful sugar paper, no one knows whether it is candy or stone after opening.
Non-existent crystal shoes and false fairyland
My complete disillusionment with the fairy tale world started when I learned that the crystal shoes in Cinderella's story would never exist in the real world.
A normal person, wearing crystal shoes (not to mention high heels), will become an extremely painful thing even standing, it is even less likely to dance at the ball, and have to leave in a hurry near midnight.

Once the magical and non-realistic content in fairy tales is stripped out with realistic thinking, it will have "holes." If we use this set of subversive thinking to interpret more fairy tales or children ’s works, guess what they will become-the "bottleneck" in "Andersen's Fairy Tales" is actually to convey the true meaning of breaking the jar; The "Selfish Giant" in Wilde ’s Fairy Tales is likely to be a fierce battle between social fear patients and bear children; not to mention Zheng Yuanjie ’s Rubik ’s Cube Building, which is already a shadow of many people ’s childhood, even without interpretation. The plot is also terrifying.
At least the "Alice" series of fairy tales should be regarded as the story farthest from this "dark" element. Whether it is "Alice in Wonderland" or "Alice in the Mirror", when Lewis Carroll was writing, he was talking to a little girl, so they showed a child's perception and exploration of the world , In which adult senses are less endowed.
However, from an adaptation perspective, the "Alice" series can change thousands of different colors due to the many characters in the story, the twists and turns, full of magical colors, and the lack of a distinct story core. Especially in that dream wonderland, how was it constructed and how should it be interpreted? Many game works also discussed this. Let me cite two examples here-

**"Alice's Spiritual Trial"**
This work only borrows the name of the characters in the "Alice" series of stories, such as Cheshire Cat, Queen of Hearts, Caterpillar, etc. It tells about a tragedy of friendship and a spirit of self-atonement that took place on campus Trial. The gameplay is a combination of the typical plot copy choice and the reasoning method of "Reversal Referee", but because of the plot, it is slightly gloomy overall. The "Fairyland" in this work is a fantasy world of judgment. The protagonist Alice constantly reflects on and analyzes the mistakes she has made, and restores all kinds of events that have happened. She gradually retrieves her memory to find the story. The truth. The plot turned several times during this period, and the character's identity was constantly changed in suspicion.

**"Alice's Mad Return"**
The fairyland world in this work is also the spiritual world of Alice. Everything here is a reflection of the real world she is facing.
At first, a fantasy fairyland was revealed in front of the player. Soon, the girl statue began to leave black tears, the island was breaking, and the wraiths were wandering around ... The world was collapsing, and Alice was fighting across obstacles in this broken world. Corresponding to all this, Alice in the real world is receiving psychiatric treatment about "forgetting" in a psychiatric hospital.
The repressed quality did not defeat Alice, but caused her to recover her lost memory under extreme pain. Alice in Wonderland walks back to the real world and avenges her culprit that brought her endless suffering.
In both works, Wonderland has become a manifestation of the spiritual world.
This may be due to the fact that it is free from the characteristics of innocence and false fairyland, and it is necessary to borrow cruel but real life as the soil in order to take root.Big deal, there is a piece of sugar paper.

Fairy tales, or dark fairy tales, are essentially stories, but the narrator and the object of the story are different.
Some people say that the core of fairy tales should be good, because children should first learn to understand the light when they first know the world, and let love fill their hearts. But recognizing the light is not just looking at the sun, the shadow will make the light appear so soft and warm.
Many stories may not be suitable for children to tell at the beginning, but as time goes by, fairy tales are constantly changing, more suitable for children's reading.
Previously, some mothers questioned that "Daughter of the Sea" should not be told for children. She believed that the little mermaid wanted to become a vassal of a man in order to become a human suffering. She was right, although the story has not been finished yet. All the efforts of the Little Mermaid eventually turned into a bubble in a tragic love story. Of course, they also broke away from the emotional shackles of the vassal to seek for their own independent and indestructible souls. From the daughter of the sea to the daughter of the sky, they turned into elves controlling the rules.

A mermaid has not an immortal soul, nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being. On the power of another hangs her eternal destiny. But the daughters of the air, although they do not possess an immortal soul, can, by their good deeds, procure one for themselves.
These bold deconstructions endowed many works with a rebellious spiritual connotation, crumbling fairy tales into real life, and creating those "dark" stories: Little Red Riding Hood may have become a hunter by itself, and the prince of Cinderella may be a murderous demon The classic villain image of the big bad wolf is likely to be both smart and kind.
And who knows these truths?
What we need to be wary of is a fairy tale distorted simply because of an injustice in our heart. What we need to be wary of is the anxiety of merchants selling vigorously-they will declare the so-called "truth", inducing people to fear their past perceptions.
The world is diverse and rich, and so is fairy tales. No one's interpretation is "unique".
At this point, the proposition "Schrodinger's sugar" is much easier than Schrodinger's cat. Schrödinger's cat only gives you two options, the cat is either dead or alive.
If the peeled skin is filled with sugar, then eat it; if it is stoned, at least a beautiful piece of sugar paper will remain, will it?
