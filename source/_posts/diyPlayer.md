Ten years ago, when we talked about DIY, most of us only knew the character's hands,   cool weapons, and we brought the existence of the second-dimensional world to the three-dimensional world through our hands.

 Nowadays, with the emergence of many high-freedom and even open-world games, it provides many exploration players and creative players with more opportunities to play, and they have more  realistically restored the existence of three-dimensional to the world of two-dimensional. We no longer need to buy materials, we don't need to be afraid of failure, we just need a mobile phone to open the game to create a unique DIY.

The emergence of the creative workshop has allowed players to open new doors to DIY  and begin to make their own DIY levels, and also reproduced many excellent game prototypes.

 It is these DIY levels, whether they are made by minicraft or Mario, or they have been defeated by human beings, which have brought us endless happiness in the live broadcast.
