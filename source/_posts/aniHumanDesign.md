As a good entertainment product, games need a lot of game settings to design gamemechanisms to enrich and enrich the game content. For the popular works, there must be subtle settings that  allow players to "cool to fly", such as the possession element in Mario Odyssey, which greatly improves the game's playability.

However, not all settings of any game can be just right. Contrary to the  above-mentioned "good" settings, some game settings not only do not increase the player's coolness, but even place unreasonable restrictions everywhere, making people feel anti-human. Today we are going to talk about  these wonderful settings.

The exotic setting in the game is not uncommon. For example, ribbons in Resident Evil, complex and uninteresting base construction in Metal Gear Solid V, and so on. In addition to this, there are map settings in the Blade of Xenophobia 2 and settings that can not be skipped in the final fantasy, which make most players think it is better to change.

No matter what the setting is, the original intention of the game author is to hope  that players can play happily. But the author has self-expression needs, and his thoughts will be embodied in  these settings. No matter what kind of setting, it is an indispensable content of the game and a performance of the design concept. If the expression is correct and the player is poised to cheer, that is the magic stroke; but if it goes in the wrong direction, it will become unreasonable or even strange.

So, what are the strange anti-human settings you have encountered in the game? Why not  share your experience with other players!
