In the development of a game, there are often some unique nonsense, stems, and even a unique game culture of its own. These things will spread among the players of the game, so that when you see a certain sentence, you will naturally think, "Oh, that game."

For example, in the Hearthstone legend, the battle mode has recently been in flames.  Among them, the well-known yin-yang man, Bob, is often used by war players to ridicule, such as "I think you can win this game."

But many times I will lose. For another example, the famous game character Yasuo sentence of League of Legends.
"Death is like the wind, always with me."
As soon as they see this sentence, players will immediately think of League of  Legends, Summoner Canyon.

Presumably there is such an exclusive case statement in the game you like. As long as  you mention it, you can make the fans understand, and also achieve the case effect to other players
