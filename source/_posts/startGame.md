###  Will you start the game?

If you want mobile game players to list out "the game nouns you love and hate," and "swipe initial", you must be on the list.
In recent years, from "Sword and Expedition" to "Princess Connection", these works that already have a stable game environment in the foreign service have pushed the player's head into the "brush initial", which makes people dizzy

On the one hand, it allows players to get a better start experience under limited financial expenditure; on the other hand, the boring initial process and various kinds of attention are also painful. Carrot and stick-like "swipe initial" experience often make players cry and laugh.

"Should I brush the initial?"-Faced with a completely strange game environment, I believe you and I will wander. "What is good, how to brush?" Facing the intricate characters and card pool, I believe you and I will be distressed.

Behind the worries of players, the gray industry of "Initial Number" has also continued to develop ...
So, will you refresh the initial game? What about the initial behavior?

###  Why do you like playing games?
The original intention of the game was to kill time, bring entertainment and spiritual satisfaction. The simple game allows us to temporarily relax our nerves, the high-operation game makes us immersed in the thrill of running through the clouds, the plot game is like performing a movie, and the horror game uses the weakness of the deep heart to create stimulation.

In the eyes of many people, games are no longer an ordinary form of entertainment. Many people around us, or ourselves, some people have known each other in the game; some people have a very deep research on a certain type of game; some people have played a game to the top; Some people turn games into lifelong careers.

Everyone should have more or less emotion. The reasons for playing games are probably different for everyone. It may be a few words, it may be an endless heart.

### An irrational loop in the game

I do n’t know if you have encountered the “Penrose Ladder” in the game: brushing equipment is for better copying, copying is for better equipment, brushing equipment is for better copying, copying is for more Get the equipment well ... This matryoshka-like gaming experience is like a sophisticated chain of chains, which will collapse after a little disconnection, allowing players to run like Sisyphus.

This kind of irrational death cycle is like the final BOSS of your game experience, like the tarsal maggots, ambushing in every corner of every game. It might be crouching down on your long way to "greedy her body", it might be transformed into the big red character of a wolf, it might be hiding in every corner of the difficult copy ...
In most cases, while the players are miserable, the producers are also likely to meditate: The Ark of Tomorrow, who has just won the third prize in the game awards, was once dubbed "dead loop" The level experience is then improved immediately in the open beta.
So, have you ever been trapped in this "Panlos ladder" and escaped unsuccessfully but no one cried? Then hurry up and talk in the gossip, share your experience!
