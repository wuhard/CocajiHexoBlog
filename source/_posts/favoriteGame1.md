Let's talk about the largest category of games:** role-playing games**.
One of the reasons we love games so much is that we can play roles in the game that we can't become in daily life and experience different stories and lives. This is the core element of a  "role-playing game."

You can play any role you want in the game. You can become a superhero who saves the  world, a homeless swordsman who broke into the mainland alone, a cold spy in the center of spy warfare, and  can even dream back to the ancient times and experience the ancient heroes ... There are so many interesting adventure stories, there is always a role that fits perfectly with the person you dream of.
