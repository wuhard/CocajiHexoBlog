###  1 What games do you want not to play or uninstall?

"The young man walks away, the wheat field remains."

With the change of technology, the game market has become more and more diverse, and the game world has become more and more colorful. In today's games, the graphics are more refined, the types are more varied, and the product changes are more frequent. But when we are chasing new games, in the ever-changing game library, there will always be some games that are not often played, but they are also reluctant to uninstall and say goodbye, just like an old maple leaf hidden deep in our favorite book.

Which games will give you this kind of contradictory feeling of "don't play or uninstall"? Do you remember the previous gaming experience? What unique memories do these games bring to you?

Time flies, either because of learning or work, we will no longer open these games. But there seemed to be a voice still in my heart, still waiting ... and finally chose to cherish it silently.

Presumably the topic of this issue is the real experience that many players have, so what is the reason for everyone to push these games to the bottom? Maybe they make us feel moved, or maybe they carry our growth for a certain period of time. I hope that one day, when we play again, our original intentions will remain the same and we will reap the joy of the beginning!
So, what games do you have at the bottom of the box that attract you to download even if you do n’t play for a long time? Discuss with everyone!

###  2  Let's compile a game that I like to hear
As the saying goes, curiosity kills the cat. The same is true for gamers.
 
Whenever the version is updated, major events are coming, or when the sequel is released, interested people are always looking forward to it and looking forward to it. During this period, all kinds of breaking news and gossip have naturally become the information that everyone is most concerned about.

To say the most famous news, I am afraid that when World of Warcraft has not updated the burning expedition version, a post claiming "update 2.0 next week" also directly created the term "Uncle Party". Unfortunately, it turns out that this is fake news, and countless players have missed expectations.

And there are a lot of breaking news that was finally confirmed. For example, the "turn-based design" that was officially released by the Rulong series of officials on April Fools' Day ago ... actually came true, and it was also a surprise.

So, in this issue, let ’s use our brains and “paint cakes” on the spot to compile a piece of news that makes people happy! Of course, if you are willing, you can also share with you what you have seen that seems to be really interesting and interesting news ~

### 3 Talk about the game you have played the longest
Games have already become a part of our lives, whether it is to pass the fragmented time or for a thought in one's heart. However, in this era of fast-moving games with so many games, too many choices may make us dazzled. A game enters our lives like a passenger, but it is difficult to stop and remain.
However, in this long time, there will be such a game that will stay in your life for a long time and become the game you play the longest. This game is of great significance to you: maybe there are people who are very important to you in the game; maybe the game itself has a deep bond with you; or this game has changed your lifestyle and created the current you.
