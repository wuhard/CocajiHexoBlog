### Brief Introduction 
The population is 105 million. There are about 80 ethnic groups in the country,  mainly Oromo (40%), Amhara (30%), Tigray (8%), Somalia (6%), and Sidamo (4 %). 45% of the residents believe in Ethiopia, 40-45% believe in Islam, 5% believe in Protestantism, and the rest believe in primitive religion. Amharic is a federal working language, English is also widely used, the main national languages are Oromo,Tigray, etc. One interesting policy for their president is that the "Presidential Bill" passed by the  Ethiopian People's Representative House in October 2001 stipulates that: the president shall be a non-partisan person, shall not have any political organization background, and shall not participate in party activities after leaving office; when the president is unable to perform his duties due to death or illness, Parliament  appoints acting president.

Ethiopia is One of the least developed countries in the world. It is dominated by agriculture and animal husbandry, and its industrial foundation is weak. In recent years, Ethiopia has accelerated industrialization and actively built industrial parks. And also they build transportation infrastructure, there is a railway from Addis Ababa to Djibouti standard rail electrified railway provided and financed by China was completed and opened to traffic in October 2016. It was officially put into commercial operation in January 2018 with a total length of about 760 kilometers and a length of about 670 kilometers in Ethiopia. It is the only electrified transnational railway in Ethiopia. In December 2002, Ethiopian Telecom  formulated a development plan for the next 20 years, planning to invest 3.5 billion bills to provide  telecommunications services to 50 cities across the country.
