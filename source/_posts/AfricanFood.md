**Who says African food is not good? (Part A)**
 Africa, in our impression, has always been a poor and backward continent. Even food and clothing are a problem. How can there be food? If you think so, you are biased. In fact, there are quite a lot of African cuisines, but there are very few domestic introductions to this.Today I will take you to discover what is delicious in Africa!

### No.1 Morocco: the collision of Africa and Europe
Morocco is a country surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the vast Sahara Desert. The unique geographical location makes Morocco a filming location for many movies. Morocco is located in the northwestern part of the African continent, close to European countries such as Spain and Italy. Therefore, in terms of diet, Morocco perfectly blends tradition with Western tastes, giving birth to a unique Moroccan taste

#### Tajine
Tajin is the most famous traditional dish in Morocco and a must-have for various festivals and celebrations. Spread beef, mutton, chicken, or seafood on a wide, shallow clay plate, and then add vegetables and various  Moroccan spices. Then simmered for a few hours, the steamed dish was soft and savory and delicious.As a type of stew, Tajin is deeply loved by Moroccans: different ingredients can have different magical powers: you can either make a pot of fragrant yellow pheasant chicken or the exotic curry pot is in your  hands.

####  Couscous
Couscous is a traditional staple food of Moroccans, equivalent to our rice. Couscous is colorful and  unique. The bottom wheat flour absorbs the essence of the dish and looks yellow orange. The taste is soft  and strong, sweet and not greasy. The couscous, which is fragrant and delicious, tastes similar to  Guangdong Claypot Rice.

Moroccan thick soups are full of variety, and the taste of each soup is different. Lentils are standard in local thick soups. As if adding thick soup pot, the whole bowl of soup has a strong taste of chicken. With the harmony of lentils, it will not make people feel too greasy and people can't stop it.

#### Spicy sardines
Morocco is the world's largest exporter of sardines, so you will see many sardine vendors on the street stalls. It tastes like Guilin Chili Sauce. The cumin powder on the sardines adds a lot to it.  Although the meat quality is better than firewood, it is better than crisp. Walking on the streets of Morocco, don't be surprised if you see a bunch of spicy sardines in the hands of locals. Then all you have to do is: also order a bunch of sardines!

#### Mint tea
Mint tea is the national tea of Morocco. Locals drink it all year round, and they proudly call it "Moroccan Whiskey". The brewed tea has the fragrance of green tea and mint, which is sweet and refreshing. Have a cup of mouthwash before meals, and a cup of net taste after meals. The effect of  mint tea is just like mints. In addition, roses, cloves, jasmine and other spices are often added to increase the richness of the taste.

### No.2 Kenya: One side of soil and water side taste
It is said that Kenya is one of the better developed countries in terms of Africa.Kenyan cuisine can be roughly divided into three parts: the eastern coast, the central rift valley,and the western steppe. When you get to different areas, you eat different things.
#### Eastern Coast: The Seafood World
When you come to the Kenyan coast, how can you not taste the seafood? The buffet only costs 30-50 dollars, and you can taste all the seafood that can be caught on the seabed in Kenya.  Most fish are lake in new fresh sea bass and African crucian carp, most of them will belly stuffed  with fresh vegetables. The value of the roast is average, but the taste is super! The crispy grilled fish can be eaten with bones, without any fishy smell, it is my dish!
