#### Central Rift: Fruit Paradise
The Central Rift Valley in central Kenya has fertile soil and is an important crop producing area. People who  like fresh fruits and vegetables can eat enough here. Bananas are very common in the local area. Steamed bananas are specialty foods with rich texture that are steamed with banana, garlic and onion. The taste is quite fragrant, and I can't stand the value of this ...

**Passion fruitis** called passion fruit locally, and it is often squeezed into fruit juice, sweet and sour.

#### The West: A Paradise for Meat Eaters
The western part of Kenya is located in the center of the "African Animal Migration", so there are many wild animals in particular.
**Nyama Choma**  is the most Kenyan-style game dish, which is a grilled meat platter that must not be missed by carnivores. It's comparable to Xinjiang's roasted whole lamb. The grilled meat platter is delicious and full of meat. One bite after another is full of meat. You can't enjoy it anywhere else!
In addition, Kenya also has [dumplings], I did not expect it! The Kenyan dumplings are triangular in shape. They are filled with meat fillings, vegetables, onions, peppers, cumin, etc. and fried. Its flavor is strong, crispy on the inside and tender on the outside. Dip a lemon juice before eating,sour and salty at the mouth, and you can eat a plate in one breath!

**The curry roast chicken** below is different from the Indian curry chicken. Its curry taste is punchier and the chicken is slightly firewood. Nevertheless, the curry roast chicken has conquered a large number of food with the richness of its curry sauce.

### No.3 Ethiopia: The most authentic African cuisine
Unlike Morocco and Kenya, Ethiopia is the only country in Africa that has not been colonized and has its own traditional cuisine.Therefore, in Ethiopia, you can taste the most authentic African taste.
#### Ingela
This thing called Ingela can be regarded as the national food of Ethiopia. As the saying goes: Shandong pancake rolls all things, Shaanxi meat clips all things. In the same way, this "Ingela" can also "roll all things." You can roll some beef, and "Beef Pancake Fruit" is ready.
Some lamb and bacon roll bar, lamb wrapped in Ingela, the endless flavor straight into the nasal cavity, but also people have no sense of smell. You can even roll around in a mess, as long as you are happy. Vegan Angela can also bring you a different taste. But there is one thing to say,how do I think this Ingela is strange, it feels like something ... By the way, isn't this a rag...

#### AMBO soda
 AMBO soda was founded in 1930. The water itself has bubbles, but it is completely different from those made from soda. It is very quiet and gentle. If you drink it in one sip, this soda will not make you feel too flush, but it will be easier to import. It can be said to be the PLUS version of "Sea of  Words". Of course, although AMBO soda calls itself "National Drink‚Äù,Ethiopia's "National Drink" must be coffee.
#### Avocado juice
The juice squeezed by this avocado is the real avocado juice! It is said that squeezing a
glass of juice requires three avocados. Concentration is the essence. Drinking a sip is like
being in the African savannah and racing with the tiger!Truthfully, African fruits are really good. Each kind of fruit is big and juicy. It is delicious! In addition to the above countries, the cuisines of these African countries are also worth remembering:
